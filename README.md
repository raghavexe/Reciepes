## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit342/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The system provides a recipe sharing platform. People can post recipes on the site. Publishers (i.e., those who post recipes) can offer fixed-price instructional courses that provide specific instructions on how to properly cook the posted dishes. The courses can be physical or remote. The system provides a social platform for chefs or foodies since they can interact in person.

### Pages

* Home : User can view all posts and have the option to create their own posts 
* View All Posts : User can view all global posts
* Create Post : User can make a new post which will appear on their profile
* User : This page shows the courses the user has published and the courses he has enrolled for.
* Edit post : User can edit their recipe post 
* Login-in : User can log in to their account 
* Register : User can create a new account with a unique username
* Recipe post : User can enroll for a course , view the recipe and check reviews or write their own.
